<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction 
The purpose of this project is to facilitate peer to peer interactions in the form of a forum. Our application
will allow WSU students to easily communicate with each other as well as answer each other's questions. 
Students will be able to search for forums specific to classes they are taking or interested in. 
These forums can be used to ask questions as well as to sell and buy old class materials.  

Development Team: Hala Ali, Adeel Asghar, Palak Patel, and Tyler Gross

GTA: Son Dang

Clients: Thomas Anter and Jahnu Best

## Scope
The scope of this project is creating the student forum for WSU students. The forum contains a login page for users to
access the application, a home page where users can view forums that they have subscribed to, the ability to chat with other users, and a search function so users can easily find the forums that they are interested in. After consulting with our clients, our stretch goals for the application include shared flashcards and Wayne State student verification through the wayne.edusearch directory in order to prevent non-WSU students from accessing the app.
